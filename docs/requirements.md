# Project Requirements

## 1. Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Description |
|----|-------------|-------------|
| FR-01 | **Dynamic Content Loading** | The application must load its content from a central JSON data file. |
| FR-02 | **Home Page View** | The main view must display a grid or list of all major sections from the text. Each item should be clickable. |
| FR-03 | **Detail Page View** | Clicking a section on the home page must navigate the user to a detailed view showing the full content for that section. |
| FR-04 | **Navigation** | Users must be able to navigate from the home page to a detail page and back to the home page. |
| FR-05 | **URL Routing** | The application should use URL hash changes (e.g., `#section-name`) to represent the current view, allowing for bookmarking and use of the browser's back/forward buttons. |

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Description |
|----|-------------|-------------|
| NFR-01 | **Performance** | The application must load quickly. All assets should be optimized. |
| NFR-02 | **Responsiveness** | The layout must adapt gracefully to different screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop. |
| NFR-03 | **Browser Compatibility** | The application must function correctly on the latest versions of major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). |
| NFR-04 | **Code Quality** | Code must be well-structured, commented, and easy to maintain. Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS should be used. |
| NFR-05 | **No Dependencies** | The project must not rely on any external libraries or frameworks (e.g., React, jQuery, Bootstrap). |

## 3. Technology Stack

- **HTML5**: For content structure.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout (Flexbox/Grid).
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**: For interactivity and dynamic content rendering.
- **JSON**: As the data source for the application content.
